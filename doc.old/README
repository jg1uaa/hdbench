* Description

 HDBENCH clone is a benchmark software like HDBENCH which is the most
famous benchmark software for Windows in Japan.
 It measures the performance of CPU (integer, floating point),
video (rectangle, circle, text, scroll, image) and disk (read, write).


* Features

 + It looks like HDBENCH very much.

 + A graphical benchmark software for Linux is rare.

 + It may be trustworthy because of open source.

 + Gettext is supported.


* Requirements

 GTK+ 1.2.0 or above is required. Get it from `http://www.gtk.org/'.
 4MB or above physical memory is required.
 This software uses assembly language. It may work only Intel PC.


* How to install

 % ./configure
 % make
 # make install

 If you want to use Japanese, specify fontset in `~/.gtkrc'.


* Details of command line options

usage: hdbench [OPTIONS]

options:
  -h | --help          display this help and exit
  -f | --font=FONT     font name used in TEXT of VIDEO
  -t | --text=FONT     string written in TEXT of VIDEO
  -V | --version       display version infomation and exit


* How to use

 Exit all application programs before using HDBENCH clone.
 While measuring, don't touch keyboard and mouse.

 + ALL
   Measure DISK, CPU, VIDEO.
   The value of TOTAL is all value divided by 10.

 + CPU
   Measure the number of times calculating floating point and integer
   per one second.

 + VIDEO
   Measure the number of times drawing rectangle, circle and text per
   one second, and scroll in 3 seconds, IMAGE in 5 seconds.

 + DISK
   Measure the transferring bytes of reading and writing per
   one second.
   Specify DRIVE and CAPACITY. CAPACITY is 10MB by default.
   When use CD-ROM, CAPACITY is 1/10.

 + EXIT
   Exit HDBENCH clone.

 + COPY
   Copy results to selection.

 + PRINT
   Print results. Write simply to lpr.

 + SYSTEM
   Display total memory, free memory, processor, OS, version of
   HDBENCH clone, and CPU clock (if possible).
   Copy system infomation to selection to click COPY in dialog.

 + GRAPH
   Display graph of results database. It is not implemented.

 + HELP
   About infomation.

 + OPTIONS
   Specify options. Now `copy the only results' and
   `copy the drive infomation,too' are implemented.

   - measure READ first (e.g. IDE busmaster)
     Check it if READ is too high.

   - copy the drive infomation,too
     If check it and click COPY, copy the drive drive infomation
     and video card name. 

   - copy the only results
     If check it and click COPY, copy the only results.

   - CD-ROM method (reading existent files)
     Measure only READ.

   - measure IMAGE,too
     Measure IMAGE.
     Display 1000 rectangles using XPutImage. Its value is frame/sec.
     The color depth must be 16bit to measure it. If the color depth
     is not 16bit, display warning message and don't measure it.


* Limits

 None.


* Tested OS

 + Debian GNU/Linux 2.1
 + Vine Linux 1.0
 + Vine Linux 1.1
 + FreeBSD(98) 3.0-RELEASE
