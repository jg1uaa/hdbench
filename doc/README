 HDBENCH clone is a benchmark software looks like HDBENCH which is the
most famous benchmark software for Windows in Japan.
 It measures the performance of CPU (integer, floating point),
video (rectangle, circle, text, scroll, image) and disk (read, write).


* Features

 + HDBENCH look and feel
 + Easy to use benchmark software for PC-UNIX
 + Written with C code, portable


* Requirements

 + GTK+-2.10.0 or later (no GTK+3 support)
 + 4MB RAM


* How to install

 % ./configure
 % make
 # make install

 While performing tests, do not touch any keys and pointing devices.

 + ALL
   Perform all (CPU, VIDEO and DISK) test.
   The value of TOTAL is (the sum of all scores / 10).

 + CPU
   Perform CPU test. The score is the number of times calculating
   floating point and integer per one second.

 + VIDEO
   Perform video test. The score is the number of times drawing
   rectangle, circle and text per one second, and scroll in 3 seconds,
   IMAGE in 5 seconds.

 + DISK
   Perform disk test. The score is the transferring bytes of reading
   and writing per one second.
   Specify target DRIVE and CAPACITY. CAPACITY is 100MB by default.

 + EXIT
   Exit HDBENCH clone.

 + COPY
   Copy results to clipboard.

 + PRINT
   Print results. Simply invoke lpr.

 + SYSTEM
   Display total memory, free memory, processor, OS, version of
   HDBENCH clone, and CPU clock (if possible).
   To copy OS and CPU information to clipboard, click "Copy" button.

 + GRAPH
   This is disabled and no plan to implement.

 + HELP
   Display author and copyright notice.

 + M/B Name
   Enter the name of your system or mainboard. It reflects M/B Name
   section in result. There is no problem to leave blank.

 + FORMAT
   There is three styles, HDBENCH clone standard, CSV multi column and
   CSV single column.

   See RESULTS.sample to all result format example.

 + OPTIONS
   - copy results with drive information
     This enables the result contains disk drive information (from
     dmesg). This options affects only both "HDBENCH clone standard"
     format and unchecked "copy results only" option specified.

   - copy results only
     This suppresses copying benchmark description to clipboard.

   - perform IMAGE test
     This enables IMAGE test. Method is displaying 1000 rectangles by
     XPutImage. Score is frame/sec.
     Supported color depth is 8bit, 16bit and 24bit.


* Limits

 None.
